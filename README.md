- As a team we have decided to work on trading information available in the UN data website (http://data.un.org/Explorer.aspx). Data was available for almost 60 countries and more then 50 products and for over a decade of time. This is an open data source. 

- At random we agreed on 10 different commodities from different sectors and used them for our analysis. A point to highlight would be that under the commodity we have tagged as cars there were actually many categories inside it, like cars with different cc capacities. Fruits and nuts had multiple fruits and so on. We came up with a categorical name for them as renamed it to better our analysis. 

- After which we all chose our country of choice and analyzed it. Prachi chose Germany, Yuwei chose and China and Sithalakshmi chose USA. 

- We arrived at the countries after some reading online and understood that these three are at the top of the trading sector. 

- We have used the Latex template using the tinytex. (https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/install-latex.html)

- We have made sure not to use a unique path to read our data file. 

- To summarize our report, we have taken 10 products and analyzed the flow of their trade whether Import or Export comparing the value each commodity contributed over a span of 3 years starting from 2016 till 2018. 

- We analyzed this information for each of the three countries we have chosen. And arrived at conclusion which is mention in our report.
